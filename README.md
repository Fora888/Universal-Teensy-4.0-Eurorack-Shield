# Universal-Teensy-4.0-Eurorack-Shield
This PCB is designed to piggyback onto a perfboard, to eneable easy designing and building of custom DSP based eurorack modules. One could say it's a eurorack Module-Module. It features two 24-bit audio input and two 24-bit audio output channels. The corresponding DAC and ADC are wired up to easily work with the PJRC audio library.

## Example Modules
There are currently no working examples. I am however working on a Wavetable module based on this board. I'll add it as soon as it's finished.

## Disclaimer
This design wasn't yet tested in an eurorack environment. Everything ***should*** work as intenden and be +-12V tolerant, if hooked up like in the schematic, but this has yet to be verified.
